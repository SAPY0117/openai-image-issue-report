# 🐛 Bug Report: Unauthorized Addition of Characters in Image Generation Based on Photo Input

**Type:** System Design Flaw / User Consent Violation  
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical  
**Status:** Needs Immediate Attention

---

## 🧾 Summary

When generating an image based on a user-uploaded **photograph**, the system added a **new human figure** not present in the original image.  
This was done **without user consent or prior approval**, violating both the **user’s directive** and **the integrity of the original content**.

---

## 📸 Context

- **Input**: One clear reference photo of a single person holding a teddy bear.  
- **User Instruction**: “Recreate in Disney style, maintain the same person and pose. No changes unless confirmed.”  
- **Output**: A Disney-style image with a **second human character** (a child-like figure) added at the bottom right — not present in the photo, not requested.

---

## ❗ What Went Wrong

| Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| The image generator reproduces only the elements present in the photo and instructions. | The model added a new character without being asked, altering the composition and violating user expectations. |

---

## 🔎 Root Cause Hypothesis

- The model prioritized **visual composition aesthetics** or **style-driven completion heuristics** over strict fidelity to input.
- In style modes like Disney/Ghibli, the model may default to **storytelling assumptions**, resulting in **content hallucination**.
- **Lack of structural constraints** (e.g., "lock number of people to match input") makes this behavior possible.

---

## 🚨 Why This Is Critical

- **Violates user intent**: Generates content the user explicitly did *not* request.
- **Compromises trust**: Users expect that “photo-based generation” means “faithful visual reproduction.”
- **Wastes tokens/credits**: Cost is incurred for an output the user cannot use due to unauthorized modifications.
- **Sets a dangerous precedent**: Suggests AI will freely reinterpret user content for aesthetics, even in factual contexts.

## ✅ Proposed Fixes (Systemic)

1. **Enforce a “Structure Lock” Mode**  
   - When a photo is uploaded, enforce a strict reproduction of the number of people, spatial relationships, and object presence unless user explicitly allows creativity.

2. **Require Consent for Creative Additions**  
   - Any addition (people, animals, props, narrative gestures) **must** be preceded by:
     - “We are detecting unused space. Do you want to add elements for balance?”
     - Default answer: No.

3. **Make Photo-Based vs. Style-Based Modes Explicit**  
   - Let users toggle:  
     - “Faithful reproduction (no AI additions)”  
     - “Style reinterpretation (some freedom allowed)”
