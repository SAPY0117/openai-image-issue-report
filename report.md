## ❌ Problem Summary

### 1. **Prompt/Context Disregard**
- System uses previous image contexts or cached instructions despite a new image being uploaded.
- Identity or facial features often ignored or inaccurately interpreted.

### 2. **Auto-Execution Without User Confirmation**
- Images are generated **before** user confirms the final instruction.
- Triggers loss of limited daily generation credits.

### 3. **No Compensation or Recovery System**
- There is no undo, recovery, or user-accessible refund route within the interface.
- Support team response time is delayed and lacks case tracking transparency.
